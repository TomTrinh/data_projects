This project started off when my former colleague introduced me this [[http://thewall-usa.com/index.asp][website]] a
few months ago. You can read about his data collection ([[http://rpubs.com/chidungkt/313857][here]]) and analysis
([[http://rpubs.com/chidungkt/343736][here]]).

This is my attempt to rewrite the web crawling part to be a bit more elegantly.
Just a weekend exercise. For playing with the data set, you can visit the USA's
National Archival [[https://catalog.archives.gov/id/2240992][Databases]].

Though this project is solely interested in data stuffs, specifically web
scraping and data tidying, I still want to take note of one non-data thing that
I found along the way.

- They, the US government, use the phrase 'Vietnam Conflict' in lieu of 'Vietnam
  War' in their papers.
