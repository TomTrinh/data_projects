This project started off when my former colleague introduced me this
[website](http://thewall-usa.com/index.asp) a few months ago. You can read about
his data collection ([here](http://rpubs.com/chidungkt/313857)) and analysis
([here](http://rpubs.com/chidungkt/343736)).

This is my attempt to rewrite the web crawling part to be a bit more elegantly.
Just a weekend exercise. For playing with the data set, you can visit the USA's
National Archival Databases[fn:1].

Though this project is solely interested in data stuffs, specifically web
scraping and data tidying, I still want to take note of one non-data thing that
I found along the way.

- They, the US government, use the phrase 'Vietnam Conflict' in lieu of 'Vietnam
  War' in their papers.
